# **Bank Churn Prediction**

This project develops a **machine learning model** to predict **customer churn** for a bank. Using customer demographic and transaction data, the model identifies patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

## **📌 Project Overview**

- **Goal:** Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank).
- **Dataset:** Includes customer attributes like age, balance, credit score, and transaction history.
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## **🔍 Research Questions**

1. **Which customer attributes are the strongest predictors of churn?**
2. **How do transaction patterns correlate with churn?**
3. **Does the length of a customer’s relationship affect churn likelihood?**
4. **How does geographic location impact churn?**
